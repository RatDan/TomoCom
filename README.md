# **Google-services.json file required**

TomoCom requires a google-services.json file to function properly. This file is required to use Firebase services such as authorization and database.

# **Instructions for adding the file:**

Download the google-services.json file from the Firebase console.

Place it in the app directory of your Android project.

Make sure the file is not added to your version control system (e.g. .gitignore).

Restart the project and build the app.

# **Important**

Without the google-services.json file, the app will not start properly or may generate errors related to Firebase.
